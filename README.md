# Get-3-Letter-UPlays
Writes all available 3 letter Uplay names to a notepad file


This following software will print all availible 3 letter names to a notepad file. 
Why does it not save the name on an account? Multiple reasons, such as you would be unable to change your name for 30 days, there may be some that you like than others, etc

NOTE : Software is broken! It currently prints all possible combinations of 3 letter strings to a notepad file, it does not actually check if theyre availible. 
I will need to update the checkUsername function to work with the Ubisoft API and verify that a username is actually availible before inserting it into our vector.
